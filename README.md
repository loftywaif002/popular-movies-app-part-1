This is Part-1 of a project in Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to built an app, 
that is to help users discover popular and most rated movies on the web. It displays a scrolling grid of movie posters and  
when a  particular movie is selected, it launches a details screen with title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis, 
allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews. This app utilizes core Android user interface components and 
fetches movie information using themoviedb.org API.
